ParticleEmitterDemo-GLKit-ARC
===========================

Sample project showing a particle system running in an GLKit + ARC based project.

This project provides the basic elements needed to create an OpenGL ES 2.0 context and then load and run a particle system configured inside Particle Designer. No 3rd party frameworks are required so this code can easily be built into your own project.
